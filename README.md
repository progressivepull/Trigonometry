# Trigonometry
Trigonometry is a fascinating branch of mathematics that deals with angles, triangles, and periodic functions. Here are some fundamental chapters or topics commonly covered in trigonometry:

* **1. [Introduction to Trigonometry](./Introduction_to_Trigonometry.ipynb) –** Basics of angles, trigonometric ratios, and their applications.
* **2. Trigonometric Functions –** Sine, cosine, tangent, secant, cosecant, and cotangent functions.
* **3. Trigonometric Identities –** Important identities like Pythagorean identities, sum and difference formulas, double angle and half-angle identities.
* **4. Graphs of Trigonometric Functions –** Plotting sine, cosine, and tangent functions and understanding their periodic behavior.
* **5. Inverse Trigonometric Functions –** Properties and applications of arc sine, arc cosine, and arc tangent functions.
* **6. Trigonometric Equations –** Solving equations using trigonometric identities and inverse functions.
* **7. Applications of Trigonometry –** Real-world problems involving heights, distances, and navigation.
* **8. Law of Sines and Law of Cosines –** Using trigonometry in non-right triangles.
* **9. Complex Numbers and Trigonometry –** Euler’s formula, De Moivre’s theorem, and their applications.
* **10. Polar Coordinates and Parametric Equations –** Representing points and functions in polar form.
